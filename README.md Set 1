# System Resource Monitoring Script

## Overview
This Bash script monitors CPU, memory, network activity, disk usage, system load, processes, and essential services. It provides a **dashboard-style output**, allowing users to call specific monitoring sections via command-line switches.

## How to Use

### **1. Make the Script Executable**
Run the following command:
```bash
chmod +x monitor.sh

#Run the script with different command-line flags:
./monitor.sh -cpu       # Shows top 10 CPU-consuming applications
./monitor.sh -network   # Displays network statistics
./monitor.sh -disk      # Checks disk space usage
./monitor.sh -load      # Shows system load
./monitor.sh -memory    # Displays memory stats
./monitor.sh -processes # Lists top processes
./monitor.sh -services  # Monitors essential services
